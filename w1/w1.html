      <h1>Principles and Practices, Project Management</h1>
      <p>
        Officially the first week started on Wednesday, 27th, February. But we had a few conversations with our remote instructor Mr. Francisco Sanchez, via
        slack and SIP calls. As he instructed we had signed up at
        <a href="https://www.fablabs.io/">fablabs.io</a>
        and
        <a href="http://git.fabacademy.org/fabacademy2016/fablabtrivandrum">Git-repo</a>.
        <br>
        Anyway, on the first day, at local time 19.30 IST, we had a long lecture by Neil via video conference. The audio wasn't the best quality and I lost
        the flow, but I found the
        <a href="https://vimeo.com/153263942">video at vimeo</a>. In essence, I had to do the following for the first week.
        <ul>
          <li>Create a personal web-page where I will be writing all these.</li>
          <li>Setup Git account and push the website to the correct destination so that our page is linked to the entries
            <a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/fablabtrivandrum/">here
            </a>and
            <a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/master/students.html">here</a>.</li>
          <li>Generate the personal ssh-key pair and upload the public key to the Git.</li>
          <li>Draft a possible final project and upload a rough sketch.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Website</h2>
      <p>
        I had some experience with building website during the Pre-Academy program. I used
        <a href="https://atom.io/">atom</a>
        editor for writing in html5. I used some .css scripts from one of the themes provided by the github to theme (mainly the text color and background) my
        page. I refer
        <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3schools</a>
        for most of the doubts. I might move to something new, like HEXO theming engine, which I found being used by one student in China or Japan (don't
        remember exactly, I was randomly opening student pages and I came across a beautiful site).

      <h2>Git and setting up the key</h2>
      <p>
        For the Pre-Academy we hosted our site at
        <a href="https://github.com/">github</a>. Now we are supposed to host our site at
        <a href="http://git.fabacademy.org">git.fabacademy.org</a>. This is a dedicated GitLab server run for FabAcademy. The general usage is same as that of github. We had to signup at
        <a href="https://www.fablabs.io/">fablabs.io</a>
        and use that to create an account at our
        <a href="http://git.fabacademy.org/fabacademy2016/fablabtrivandrum">local-repo</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can access the git via ssh or https protocol, though I prefer ssh access, because the ease of use. For this we have to generate a ssh-key pair and
        upload the public key to server (in progile settings>ssh keys section). Following this
        <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/">tutorial
        </a>
        makes the process very easy.
        <br>
        At first we were given another key, common to all of us. I used this to pull the repo, make my page and push it for the first time. Later I generated
        my own key pair and uploaded it, once the 'admin' gave me developer access I could 'push' with my own keys. Our remote instructor, Franc wrote a
        tutorial on setting up the repo
        <a href="http://beachlab.org/fab2016/repo.html">here</a>. Though I faced some issues while changing the key, I resolved it by deleting the
        corresponding entries in ~/.ssh/known_hosts file and following the troubleshooting section in Franc's tutorial.
      </p>
      <h3>Dealing with passphrase for ssh.</h3>
      <p>
        It seems many people (including me at first) hesitated to use a passphrase while creating ssh key-pair. This might be because, if you do this, you
        will be asked to enter the passphrase each time you try to push/pull. We don't want to do that, and the trick is to use 'ssh-agent'.
        <br>Make sure that ssh-agent is running by
        <br>
        <code>eval `ssh-agent -s</code>.
        <br>
        If the agent is not running start it by.
        <br>
        <code>exec ssh-agent bash</code>
        <br>sometime you may get the following error even if ssh-agent is running, I got it fixed by typing the above command.
        <br>
        <pre>
          [sibu@archSSD ~]$ ssh-add
          Could not open a connection to your authentication agent.
        </pre>
        Now add your ssh identity.
        <code>ssh-add</code>
        <br>
        <pre>
          [sibu@archSSD ~]$ ssh-add
          Enter passphrase for /home/sibu/.ssh/id_rsa:
          Identity added: /home/sibu/.ssh/id_rsa (/home/sibu/.ssh/id_rsa)
          [sibu@archSSD ~]$
        </pre>
        <br>
        check if your identity has been added.
        <code>ssh-add -l</code>
        <br>
        <pre>
          [sibu@archSSD fab2016]$ ssh-add -l
          4096 SHA256:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx /home/sibu/.ssh/id_rsa (RSA)
        </pre>
        <br>
        Now you dont't have to enter your passphrase all the time. In case if you created a key-pair without passphrase, you can set one without recreating
        the key by
        <code>ssh-keygen -p</code>
        , but you have to add identity again,
        <code>ssh-add</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>Edit:-</h2>
        You must have noticed it already; this site is not in the class repo, it has been redirected to my github pages. I have explained the reasons in my
        <a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/fablabtrivandrum/students/281/">landing page</a>
        and I will go back once I'm done. As I said many of the important ports such as port 22 is blocked in the faster Internet connection. I use the
        following workarounds for faster sync with online repo.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had only one option if I have to do things faster, use the restricted but faster network, but somehow get around the restrictions. For Github things
        were very easy, I found that the port 443 is open, I used
        <a href="http://angryip.org/">angryip scanner</a>
        to do that. Luckily Github also supports port 443 for SSH access (not the class repo). So now its just a matter of editing
        <code>>~/.ssh/config</code>
        file. I added the following line to this file (actually the file wasn't there, so I just created one!).
        <br>
        <pre>Host github.com
                Hostname ssh.github.com
                Port 443
        </pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        But, it's not over, I need to push to class archive too, and the above method won't work. So I decided to try VPN. I have been using VPN for some
        time. So I decided to stay one free service that I always find trustworthy,
        <a href="http://www.vpnbook.com/">vpnbook</a>. I downloaded the openvpn profile bundle for Euro-2 server (which was the fastest from my experience).
        If you are doing this for the first time you may have to install the 'openvpn'. Run
        <code>sudo openvpn --config
          <path to config file></code>, enter super-user/admin password, enter vpn username (vpnbook) and password (check the site, updated weakly), and you are
          good to go. I used port 53 as that's a port open on most networks as it is used for DNS queries.
          <br>
          So once the VPN is setup you might see a new network named 'tun0' or something when you type
          <code>ifconfig</code>. Anyway once I had the VPN, everything was working fine, all ports are now open, and I can now save a lot of time !

        <h2>Project Draft</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>EDM based CNC PCB mill</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_discharge_machining">EDM</a>
          or Electrical Discharge Machining is also known as spark machining, spark eroding, die sinking. Perhaps the name gives some clues regarding the
          process. The technique uses the sparks to erode material away to get the desired final structure. The technique is that the spark between two
          electrodes removes material from both the electrodes. One of the electrode known as the tool can be just a thin wire which is kept at a small
          separation from the other electrode known as the workpiece. The electrodes are submerged in dielectric liquid (commonly water), which acts as coolant
          and cleaning liquid which flushes the milling siite. The tool need not be a wire all the time, in Die-sink EDMs its a die made of solid metal.
          <br>
          The system requires some way of generating a controlled electrical pulses, the rate of which determines the material removal rate. I believe that this
          technique, if implemented the way I want to, can mill PCB's with very narrow tracks and separation, which cannot be produced by conventional milling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the idea is that we will have an X-Y CNC machine with a 3D-printer like head extruding the tool wire (the tool wire gets eroded). The PCB will be
          submerged in a bath of water and the tool-head moves in a raster pattern to remove the material where it is not required. The raster pattern, because
          the technique works only on conductors, and if we have to use vector files, the tool path predictor will have to be complicated. The X-Y movement can
          be achieved with two actuators from CD/DVD drives. The working area will be very small but for a proof-of-concpet machine that will do just fine.
        </p>

        <br>
        So I plan to make an X-Y axis similar to what is seen
        <a href="http://makezine.com/2015/07/20/build-drawbot-two-cd-drives-raspberry-pi/">here</a>.

      <br>
      The tool wire extruder will be similar to what that of a 3D-printer.
      <br>
      The merits of this system would be
      <ul>
        <li>Can have extremely close tracks which is impossible with the conventional milling machines.</li>
        <li>This is a technique for PCB machining, at-least I couldn't find one.</li>
        <li>Eco friendly, because no chemicals, no dust.</li>
        <li>This machine could be used for drilling tiny holes on metal.</li>
        <li>This may be useful for cutting metal sheet, for example to make a stencil from a soda can for applying solder paste.</li>
        <li>can be used for making tiny metal gears.</li>
        <li>And finally, no broken bits anymore.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      Even if this project is implemented correctly there will be drawbacks, like
      <ul>
        <li>Slow speed machining.</li>
        <li>Chances of electrical short and shock (especially since water and electricity comes together).</li>
        <li>Messy, there is a water bath and water circulation system included.
        </li>
        <li>Consumes more power than other PCB milling.</li>
        <li>The machine cannot cut the PCB (substrate), so you will have to manually cut the required area from a larger piece of copper clad board.</li>
      </ul>
