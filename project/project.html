        <h1>SPARKY The Electrical Discharge Machining PCB Mill</h1>
        <p>
            The name explains everything, doesn't it?
        </p>
        <p>
            If not let me show you a video that was captured during the first week of Fab Academy. I was trying to see if the technique works, (well, I know it works, but I have to show you that
            it works, thats why the video!).
            <br>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zf7_GY7GMV4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <br> In case if you haven't figured it out yet, this is basically a PCB milling machine, but the material removal is achieved with spark erosion.
        </p>

        <h2>How?</h2>
        <p>
            Anyway the process is very simple, as we all know, sparks are not good, most of the time, as it corrodes. But here we are using just that, the corrosive nature of the sparks, I'll be
            trying to tame the 'devil' and use to for good. By controlling the parameters of the sparks, the quality of the erosion could be controlled; parameteres such as frequency
            (number of sparks per second), voltage, current (or in better words charge-flow/energy per spark) etc. to control the energy deposited per area, per time. The energy/(area
            x time) or power/area determines how much material we are going to remove. Also the sacrificial electrodes diameter plays a big role, just like the diameter of CNC router
            bits.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here the sparks are not made in an air gap, instead water bath is used. It acts as a dielectric, a coolant and as a cleaning agent which cleans the work-area of eroded metal. Without
            the water as a coolant we cannot have high energy sparks without it affecting a large area, this means that if we don't use water as a coolant we cannot mill thin traces
            as fast as we want, without the trace being lifted off, or burned, or vaporised.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will be connecting one end of the power supply to the PCB and the other end to a thin wire which will be the 'milling bit'. This electrode also erodes as the process progresses, so
            this wire has to be supplied from a spool of wire and need to be extruded via something like 3d-printer head/extruder.
            <br>The tip of this wire and the PCB will all be submerged in water. The wire will be kept just above the copper to be removed and when the supply is activated, with the right
            voltage and the right spacing the electric field intensity in the water between the wire and the copper will be so high that the dielectric will break down, sending a short
            pulse. This pulse will remove material from both the wire and the copper.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the wire also erodes in the process, I'm thinking about using titanium or molybdenum wires as they have high melting point and are highly durable.
            <br> Also, since the water used will not be deionized, it will have conductivity. Even if deionized water is used, the process generates chemicals/metallic compounds that spoil
            the water.
            <br>The point I'm trying to say is that since the water will be slightly conductive, there will be electrolysis and this process will remove the material from the +ve/anode.
            Hence the copper (workpiece) will be connected to the ground/cathode, hence no material will be removed from the workpiece, though some may get deposited.
        </p>

        <h2>Merits</h2>
        <p>
            If I could do this machine as I 'dreamed'.
            <ul>
                <li>Can have extremely close tracks which is impossible with the conventional milling machines in the lab.</li>
                <li>This is a new technique for PCB machining, at least I couldn't find one.</li>
                <li>Eco friendly, because no chemicals, no dust, but there will be eroded metal and metallic compounds, especially that of copper in water, which may not be that harmful</li>
                <li>This machine could be used for drilling tiny holes in metal, any metal, hard, soft, tempered annealed doesn't matter.</li>
                <li>This may be useful for cutting metal sheet, for example to make a stencil from a soda can for applying solder paste.</li>
                <li>Can be used for making tiny metal gears.</li>
                <li>And finally, no broken bits anymore!.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Draw-backs</h2>
        <p>
            <br> Even if this project is implemented correctly there will be drawbacks, like
            <ul>
                <li>Slow speed machining.</li>
                <li>Chances of electrical short and shock (especially since water and electricity comes together), but it's will be relatively safe as we are not dealing with mains level
                    of voltages.</li>
                <li>Messy, there is a water bath and water circulation system included. </li>
                <li>Consumes more power than other PCB milling, may be, I have to confirm this.</li>
                <li>As mentioned above, the problem of electrolysis effect erroding the toolo wire.</li>
                <li>Since the process requires electrical connection to the site being machined, the gcode/tool-path generation will be slightly complicated. This is because we cannot machine
                    an area which has been electrically isolated by a previous pass. </li>
                <li>The machine cannot cut or drill the PCB (substrate), so you will have to manually drill and cut the required area from a larger piece of copper clad board.</li>
                <li>Very intolerant to even the slightest of surface imperfections and leveling errors.</li>
            </ul>
            Some of these draw backs could be fixed, for example we can add a separate end-effector for milling, which could be mounted on a servo arm, like the Auto Bed Leveling setup as seen
            in
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8eqSQNAyro">this youtube video</a> or
            <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:182889">here</a>.
            <br>
            <br> In fact I could fix the uneven surfaces and wrong leveling of the bed by adding an automatic bed leveling setup. Like what is seen in the following video.
            <br>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R8o2Sy-KPUU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <br> well, technically it's not bed leveling, because we are not leveling the bed. We are actually profiling the surface (in very low resolution), in another words, we are '2.5D
            scanning' the surface and moving the end-effector up and down according to the surface profile.
        </p>

        <h2>The Rough Idea</h2>
        <p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../w1/draft.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500" style="cursor:zoom-in" title="double click => zoom-in; single click => normal size" ondblclick="this.width='1000'" onclick="this.width='499'">
                <figcaption style="display:block; color:grey">The EDM process</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <ul>
                <li>The end-effector will be something like a 3D printer extruder without the heater. </li>
                <li>X-Y axis movements will be done using
                    <a href="http://corexy.com/index.html">core-xy</a>. Or will be a simple X-Y movement assembly.</li>
                <li>The end effector will also act as a probe for profiling the surface of the PCB for the 'auto-bed-level' function.</li>
                <li>There could be a separate spindle (on a servo arm) with a drill bit for making the via.</li>
                <li>A water pump and filter for circulating and filtering the water.</li>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/RAMPS_1.4">RAMPS_1.4</a> will be the controller.</li>
                <li>An additional power supply with/without a capacitor bank will be required for the machining process. The power-source may need to be of variable voltage and variable
                    frequency, though variable frequency could be done easily with a switching MOSFET. </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>To-Do</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Decide the approximate voltage and current level, and/or the capacitor values to be used </li>
                <li>Make the end effector, which should extrude/retract thin wires of the order a fraction of an mm. The extruder will have to supply the power to the wire too.</li>
                <li>Almost all of the parts required like the control-electronics, Stepper motors and drivers, tungsten/molybdenum wires etc are sourced already.</li>
                <li>The mechanical parts like pulleys, couplers, threaded/smooth rods, gears etc has to be salvaged or made or sourced from local/online vendors.</li>
                <li>The overall assembly need to be designed and made using acrylic.</li>
                <li>A few parts like the linear bearing for the smooth rods are already made in my
                    <a href="../w12/w12.html">Molding and Casting, Composite</a> assignment.</li>
                <li>The program will be based on 3D-Printer firmwares like Marlin.</li>

        <p>
            As a first step, I tried contacting
            <a href="https://hackaday.io/Jarrett">Jarrett</a>, whom I mentioned in my
            <a href="../w17/w17.html">Applications and Implications</a> page.
            <br> To my surprise he responded quickly with a lot of details, like the troubles he faced, his ideas and he briefed me about his work till now. He also shared a few external
            links and threads.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the difficulty he faced is the design of a wire extruder. So I decided to start working on that itself.
        </p>

        <h2>The wire Feeding Mechanism.</h2>
        <p>
            The wire feeder should be able to feed the thin wire and simultaneously supply connect it to the +ve rail of the power supply. I was thinking about a click pencil mechanism or a normal
            pinch wheel mechanism. I decided to stick with the pinch wheel mechanism as it seems simple.
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea is to use a rubber wheel found in the paper feeder unit of a printer and a 608/606 bearing. I talked about us getting a few printers from the 'scrapyard' for salvaging parts
            for our
            <a href="../w9/w9.html">Mechanical Design</a> assignment. All the rods and many other parts for this project will also come from the salvaged components of the printer.
        </p>
        <p>
            I used the 626-2RS bearing and the rubber wheels from the printer. Made an assembly using acrylic to make a nice compact wire feeding mechanism.

                <figcaption style="display:block; color:grey"> As you know, the
                    <b style="color:red">red</b> lines are the cutting lines and the
                    <b style="color:black">black</b> lines and fills are the engraving area. This engraving will create a small surface depression that allows the bearing to run freely. The
                    <b>second piece will be sandwiched between two of the first type</b>. A piece of 6mm shaft will be used to mount the bearing and 4 screws will mount the sandwich to
                    the stepper motor.

                <figcaption style="display:block; color:grey"> All the three pieces cut and ready to assemble. The center piece has holes drilled into it, manually, to allow the wire to pass through.
                    <br>Also the Laser Engraving didn't work as expected it to, in first trial it just went through the boundary in the other it didn't go that deep. Since I didn't want
                    to waste those I just took a Dremel to fix it.</figcaption>

                <img src="wire-feed3.jpg" width="500" style="cursor:zoom-in" title="double click => zoom-in; single click => normal size" ondblclick="this.width='1200'" onclick="this.width='500'">
                <figcaption style="display:block; color:grey"> The two acrylic pieces in place, and the bearing is secured using a piece of the 6mm smooth rod I found from the printer. </figcaption>

                <img src="wire-feed4.jpg" width="500" style="cursor:zoom-in" title="double click => zoom-in; single click => normal size" ondblclick="this.width='1200'" onclick="this.width='500'">
                <figcaption style="display:block; color:grey"> Everything mounted and ready for a test.</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </p>

        <h3>Test</h3>
        <p>
            <video width="720" controls>
                <source src="wire feeder test.m4v" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
            <br> The video shows the wire feeder in action. The controller is the result of my
            <a href="../w11/w11.html">Input/Output</a> assignment. As evident from the test, the result is a smashing success. The grip is very good, I can even pull on the thin copper wire to make the stepper
            rotate, thats how good the grip is.
            <br>
            <b>As a bonus, this mechanism also straightens the wire, unintended, but awesome!.</b>
            <br> The only problem is feeding the wire, as of now I have to disassemble and insert the wire and assemble it back.
