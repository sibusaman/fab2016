    <h1>SPARKY The Electrical Discharge Machining PCB Mill</h1>
    <p>
      The name explains everything, doesn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      If not let me show you a video that was captured during the first week of Fab Academy. I was trying to see if the technique works, (well, I know it works, but I have to show you that
      it works, thats why the video!).
      <br>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zf7_GY7GMV4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway the process is very simple, as we all know, sparks are not good, most of the time, as it corrodes. But here we are using just that, the corrosive nature of the sparks, we are
      going tame the 'devil' and use to for good. We will control parameters of the sparks, such as frequency (number of sparks per second), voltage, current (or in better words charge
      per spark) etc. to control the energy deposited per area, per time. The energy/(area x time) or power/area determines how much material we are going to remove. Also the sacrificial
      electrodes diameter plays a big role, just like the diameter of CNC router bits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the sparks are not made in an air gap, instead water bath is used. It acts as a dielectric, a coolant and as a cleaning agent which cleans the work-area of eroded metal. Without
      the water as a coolant we cannot have high energy sparks without it affecting a large area, this means that if we don't use water as a coolant we cannot mill thin traces as fast
      as we want , without the trace being lifted off, or burned, or vaporised.
    </p>

    <h2>Merits</h2>
    <p>
      If I could do this machine as I 'dreamed'.
      <ul>
        <li>Can have extremely close tracks which is impossible with the conventional milling machines in the lab.</li>
        <li>This is a new technique for PCB machining, at-least I couldn't find one.</li>
        <li>Eco friendly, because no chemicals, no dust, but there will be eroded metal and metallic compounds, especially that of copper in water, which may not be that harmful</li>
        <li>This machine could be used for drilling tiny holes in metal, any metal, hard, soft, tempered annealed doesn't matter.</li>
        <li>This may be useful for cutting metal sheet, for example to make a stencil from a soda can for applying solder paste.</li>
        <li>Can be used for making tiny metal gears.</li>
        <li>And finally, no broken bits anymore!.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>


    <h2>Draw-backs</h2>
    <p>
      <br> Even if this project is implemented correctly there will be drawbacks, like
      <ul>
        <li>Slow speed machining.</li>
        <li>Chances of electrical short and shock (especially since water and electricity comes together), but it's will be relatively safe as we are not dealing with mains level of voltages.</li>
        <li>Messy, there is a water bath and water circulation system included. </li>
        <li>Consumes more power than other PCB milling, may be, I have to confirm this.</li>
        <li>The machine cannot cut or drill the PCB (substrate), so you will have to manually drill and cut the required area from a larger piece of copper clad board.</li>
        <li>Very intolerant to even the slightest of surface imperfections and leveling errors.</li>
      </ul>
      Some of these draw backs could be fixed, for example we can add a separate end-effector for milling, which could be mounted on a servo arm, like the Auto Bed Leveling setup as seen
      in
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8eqSQNAyro">this youtube video</a> or
      <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:182889">here</a>.
      <br>
      <br> Infact I could fix the uneven surfaces and wrong leveling of the bed by adding an automatic bed leveling setup. Like what is seen in the following video.
      <br>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R8o2Sy-KPUU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <br> well, technically it's not bed leveling, because we are not leveling the bed. We are actually profiling the surface (in very low resolution), in another words, we are '2.5D scanning'
      the surface and moving the end-effector up and down according to the surface profile.
