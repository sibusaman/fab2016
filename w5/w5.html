      <h1>3D Scanning and Printing</h1>
      <p>
        Tasks for this module involves deep understanding about 3D printer, testing the 3D printer to it's limits to find-out its capabilities and limits.
        Assignments also involves exploring various 3D scanning methods like Modella MDX-20 (R.A.P.S), Kinect other hardwares like LEAP. We have to design and
        print an object and explain why it can't be made subtractevely, and optionally make a 3D scanner ourself, print the scanned object.
      </p>
      <h2>3D Printing</h2>
      <p>
        This is an opportunity for learning and experimenting on the 3D printer. Me and
        <a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/fablabtrivandrum/students/384/index.html">
          Yadu</a>
        have assembled a 3d Printer (<a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_i3">RepRap Prusa i3</a>) . This is a perfect time to document our experience with
this machine, we learned a lot while assembling and tuning the 3D printer. Documenting our experience will benefit other people who might face same
troubles and will also help us because we can refer them later; our memories fade.
      </p>
      <h3>About 3D Printing</h3>
      <p></p>

      <h3>Assembly</h3>
      <p>
        I have purchased the 3D printer kit by a Chinese manufacturer,
        <a href="http://www.sunhokey.com/">Sunhokey</a>. I selected this model after a lot of searches and reading, it seems they have a good international
        customer base and there an active community. So even if I face any trouble I can be sure about help.
        <br>
        This was the
        <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Hot-Full-Acrylic-Quality-High-Precision-Reprap-Prusa-i3-LCD-Acquired-DIY-3d-Printer-Kit-with/2026704108.html">Aliexpress</a>
        page from which I made the purchase.
        <br>
        I also found
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH3Ozrwtfmw&list=PLKwWpCWIZu32oQLIDZva9rdffMNUz0JRl">this</a>
        set of detailed video about assembly, tuning and testing by a 'crazy' Youtube user,
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK5n0rSB1bTkpddUbSv2NUw">Hiboson</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Me and three of my friends spent about 24 hours watching video, reading instructions, assembling and debugging, before we got the first print. Here
        are some pictures. These are some old pictures, the printer was assembled during the last week of July, 2015. And we never meant to publish any of
        these images, so, sorry for the bad quality.

        The steppers had long cables and they were making a lot of problems, but I didn't want to cut them. So I decided to braid them (sixth picture). I used
        a lot of zip-ties too for cable management.
      </p>
      <p>
        The printer kit comes with an LCD and rotary switch to control, one based on
        <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRapDiscount_Smart_Controller">this</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once we powered the machine and selected 'auto-home' function, printer was going crazy, and we had to kill the power immoderately. The X-axis motor
        moves left when it was supposed to move right, one of the Z-zxis motor was also spinning the other way. This is more dangerous as the z motors
        spinning the opposite way means the z carriage will bend and eventually break. There are two fixes for it.
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li>Edit the firmware to reverse the motor's forward/default rotation direction.</li>
          <li>Swap wires from one of the two armature windings in the stepper.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        I went with the second method as it was easier at the moment, also when I don't have to redo this again when upgrading the firmware later.
      </p>
      <p>
        The stepper motor used in this printer (or most of the steppers used these days) is a bi-polar one. It has the armature windings as follows.
        <figure>
          <img src="step-wire.png" alt="stepper wiring" width='350'>
          <figcaption style="display:block; color:white">Stepper motor armature winding.

        </figure>
        <br>
        The stepper driver reverses the direction of rotation by reversing the current flow through one of the coil (done using the H-bridges). If we were to
        manually do this, we can fix the direction of rotation. First step is to identify which pin is which put of the 4-pins in th connector, this can be
        done with the help of a multimeter. Once identified the pins of anyone of the coil can be swapped. The pins can be removed from the connector by
        pressing on the retention clip and pulling on the wire simultaneously.
      </p>

      <h3>Firmware, driver, slicer....</h3>
      <p>The kit comes with
        <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/MKS_GEN_V1.1">MKS Gen-2Z v1.1</a>
        board loaded with
        <a href="http://www.repetier.com/documentation/repetier-firmware/">repetier-firmware</a>. The board is actually a single board solution of Arduino-Mega-2560 and
        <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/RAMPS_1.4">RAMPS 1.4</a>. For the controlling system, we have to install
        <a href="http://www.repetier.com/">Repetier-Host</a>. The software has all the drivers and slicer engines, also software is available for Windows, Linux and Mac platforms.
        <br>Once installed and connected, the host software is able to control the machine via its GUI, it's much better, easier and has more feature than
          what the built in control panel provides.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once everything is working, there are two ways to actually transfer the data to the printer. Through the USB connection between the printer and the
        computer using the Repetier-Host. Other method is to generate the G-Code file using any software (but with the correct parameters for this printer)
        and put it an SD-card and print from it. The printer has an SD-Card reader built into the LCD control module.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before start printing, the printer bed has to be leveled and tuned.
      </p>
      <h3>Tuning</h3>
      <p>
        The printer bed has to be leveled first. Even before this, we have to level the printer itself and more importantly the Z-carriage. A spirit-level and
        a leveled and flat surface is recommended for this step(and recommended for normal operation too).
        <br>
        Once the printer is on the flat, horizontal surface, first thing to do is level the Z-carriage. This is very important step and printer should be
        switched off during this step. We have to keep the spirit level on the Z-carriage. Its tricky, but doable, if you move the head to a side and keep the
        spirit-level on the smooth rods. The leveling is done by manually rotating one of the Z-steppers until you get a horizontal Z-carriage.
      </p>
      <p>
        After leveling the Z-carriage, now its time for leveling the bed and setting the Z-axis home position. The Z-endstop micro-switch was mounted on an
        adjustable mount, and can be adjusted for coarse changes. For fine tuning the Z-stage the screw which is going to hit the Z-end-stop has to be used.
        <br>
        For the bed-leveling , there are four thumb screws on the bed to adjust the height. Use these screws to keep the bed level. I leveled by adjusting the
        screws such that head will leave a small gap, just enough for a sheet of paper. This was done on all four corners, and the control panel on the
        printer was used to move the head to the required position.
      </p>
