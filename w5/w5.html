    <h1>3D Scanning and Printing</h1>
    <p>
      Tasks for this module involves deep understanding about 3D printer, testing the 3D printer to it's limits to find-out its capabilities and limits. Assignments also involves exploring
      various 3D scanning methods like Modella MDX-20 (R.A.P.S), Kinect other hardwares like LEAP. We have to design and print an object and explain why it can't be made subtractively,
      and optionally make a 3D scanner ourself, print the scanned object.
    </p>
    <h2>3D Printing</h2>
    <p>
      This is an opportunity for learning and experimenting on the 3D printer. Me and
      <a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/fablabtrivandrum/students/384/index.html">
        Yadu</a> have assembled a 3d Printer (
      <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_i3">RepRap Prusa i3</a>) . This is a perfect time to document our experience with this machine, we learned a lot while assembling and tuning the 3D printer. Documenting our experience
      will benefit other people who might face same troubles and will also help us because we can refer them later; our memories fade.

    <h3>About 3D Printing</h3>
    <p>3D printing, as the name implies is a method for manufacturing 3 Dimensional objects. Its an additive manufacturing technology in which the object is created by many thin layers
      of 'solid' material. The 'ink' used has a non-negligible mass and volume, so each layer will have a finite thickness and successive layers make up the final object. The process
      is computer controlled and uses various 'inks' and technologies. Wikipedia page on
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing">3D Printing</a> is a good place to start.</p>

    <h3>Assembly, Challenges and Fixes</h3>
    <p>
      I have purchased the 3D printer kit by a Chinese manufacturer,
      <a href="http://www.sunhokey.com/">Sunhokey</a>. I selected this model after a lot of searches and reading, it seems they have a good international customer base and there an active community. So even if I face
      any trouble I can be sure about help.
      <br> This was the
      <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Hot-Full-Acrylic-Quality-High-Precision-Reprap-Prusa-i3-LCD-Acquired-DIY-3d-Printer-Kit-with/2026704108.html">Aliexpress</a> page from which I made the purchase.
      <br> I also found
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH3Ozrwtfmw&list=PLKwWpCWIZu32oQLIDZva9rdffMNUz0JRl">this</a> set of detailed video about assembly, tuning and testing by a 'crazy' Youtube user,
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK5n0rSB1bTkpddUbSv2NUw">Hiboson</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Me and three of my friends spent about 24 hours watching video, reading instructions, assembling and debugging, before we got the first print. Here are some pictures. These are some
      old pictures, the printer was assembled during the last week of July, 2015. And we never meant to publish any of these images, so, sorry for the bad quality.

    <h4>Cable Management</h4>
    <p>
      The steppers had long cables and they were making a lot of problems, but I didn't want to cut them. So I decided to braid them (sixth picture). I used a lot of zip-ties too for cable
      management.
    </p>
    <h4>Print Bed</h4>
    <p>
      The print bed is a heated aluminum plate, with a
      <b style="color:yellow"> yellow</b> masking tape on it, so that the printed part can be removed easily and without damaging the aluminum bed.
    </p>
    <h4>Steppers Spinning The Wrong Way</h4>
    <p>
      The printer kit comes with an LCD and rotary switch to control, one based on
      <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRapDiscount_Smart_Controller">this</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once we powered the machine and selected 'auto-home' function, printer was going crazy, and we had to kill the power immoderately. The X-axis motor moves left when it was supposed to
      move right, one of the Z-zxis motor was also spinning the other way. This is more dangerous as the z motors spinning the opposite way means the z carriage will bend and eventually
      break. There are two fixes for it.
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>Edit the firmware to reverse the motor's forward/default rotation direction.</li>
        <li>Swap wires from one of the two armature windings in the stepper.</li>
      </ol>
      <br> I went with the second method as it was easier at the moment, also when I don't have to redo this again when upgrading the firmware later.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stepper motor used in this printer (or most of the steppers used these days) is a bi-polar one. It has the armature windings as follows.
      <figure>
        <img src="step-wire.png" alt="stepper wiring" width="350">
        <figcaption style="display:block; color:white">Stepper motor armature winding.
          <h4 style="color:grey">
            <br>image from
            <a href="http://ebldc.com/">ebldc</a>
          </h4>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <br> The stepper driver reverses the direction of rotation by reversing the current flow through one of the coil (done using the H-bridges). If we were to manually do this, we can
      fix the direction of rotation. First step is to identify which pin is which put of the 4-pins in th connector, this can be done with the help of a multimeter. Once identified
      the pins of anyone of the coil can be swapped. The pins can be removed from the connector by pressing on the retention clip and pulling on the wire simultaneously.
    </p>
    <h4>Clogging and leaking</h4>
    <p>
      I had faced clogging problems multiple times and the material was leaking out. The clogging mainly happens when using the printer after a few days of not using it, very likely because
      of the accumulated dirt. In such case I had to detach the extruder assembly and unscrew the nozzle-heater section and remove all the leftover plastic from there. I find that unscrewing
      is easier when the nozzle is at about 180 &#8451. Once I remove the nozzle, I keep heating it to about 200 &#8451 and I will put a piece of scrap the same plastic filament and
      once it is molten and flows well inside the cavity, let it cool down to about 120&#8451-100&#8451. Once 'cooled' pull on the filament slowly to get all the material inside the
      nozzle.

        <figcaption style="display:block; color:grey">The nozzle is not clean enough, because I pulled the filament at 1401&#8451, I repeated this again an 120&#8451 and I got a clean nozzle.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <br> I had to fix the leaking too. I just did what a plumber do, clean the threads and apply enough PTFE tape to get a proper seal. The thread seal was wound around the thread and
      the nozzle was screwed to the heat-sink part when it was about 200&#8451 hot, this is because when I assemble the pieces cold and heat, it becomes loose again as a result of thermal
      expansion.

        <figcaption style="display:block; color:grey">The PTFE tape applied on the heat-sink.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      I doubt is PTFE can handle temperatures around 200&#8451,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene#Safety">Wikipedia</a> page on PTFE says it starts to decompose above 200&#8451. It also says the the decomposition is major issue when the temperature is above 260&#8451. Anyway I haven't
      faced any issue so far nor did I smell anything different, lets wait and see!
    </p>

    <h3>Firmware, driver, slicer....</h3>
    <p>
      The kit comes with
      <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/MKS_GEN_V1.1">MKS Gen-2Z v1.1</a> board loaded with
      <a href="http://www.repetier.com/documentation/repetier-firmware/">repetier-firmware</a>. The board is actually a single board solution of Arduino-Mega-2560 and
      <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/RAMPS_1.4">RAMPS 1.4</a>. For the controlling system, we have to install
      <a href="http://www.repetier.com/">Repetier-Host</a>. The software has all the drivers and slicer engines, also software is available for Windows, Linux and Mac platforms.
      <br>Once installed and connected, the host software is able to control the machine via its GUI, it's much better, easier and has more feature than what the built in control panel
      provides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once everything is working, there are two ways to actually transfer the data to the printer. Through the USB connection between the printer and the computer using the Repetier-Host.
      Other method is to generate the G-Code file using any software (but with the correct parameters for this printer) and put it an SD-card and print from it. The printer has an SD-Card
      reader built into the LCD control module.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before start printing, the printer bed has to be leveled and tuned.
    </p>
    <h3>Tuning</h3>
    <p>
      The printer bed has to be leveled first. Even before this, we have to level the printer itself and more importantly the Z-carriage. A spirit-level and a leveled and flat surface is
      recommended for this step(and recommended for normal operation too).
      <br> Once the printer is on the flat, horizontal surface, first thing to do is level the Z-carriage. This is very important step and printer should be switched off during this step.
      We have to keep the spirit level on the Z-carriage. Its tricky, but doable, if you move the head to a side and keep the spirit-level on the smooth rods. The leveling is done by
      manually rotating one of the Z-steppers until you get a horizontal Z-carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      After leveling the Z-carriage, now its time for leveling the bed and setting the Z-axis home position. The Z-endstop micro-switch was mounted on an adjustable mount, and can be adjusted
      for coarse changes. For fine tuning the Z-stage the screw which is going to hit the Z-end-stop has to be used.
      <br> For the bed-leveling , there are four thumb screws on the bed to adjust the height. Use these screws to keep the bed level. I leveled by adjusting the screws such that head will
      leave a small gap, just enough for a sheet of paper. This was done on all four corners, and the control panel on the printer was used to move the head to the required position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though made for Ultimaker,
      <a href="http://support.3dverkstan.se/article/23-a-visual-ultimaker-troubleshooting-guide">this</a> guide can helpful for most of the FDM printers, very useful for troubleshooting.
    </p>

    <h3>Testing and Printing</h3>
    <p>
      We made a couple of small test prints over the time. Large prints were impossible as the power is not stable here, nobody knows when it goes and when it will be back. Many prints failed
      due to power-failure, I wish there was an option to resume prints even after rebooting/power failure(I can try this in future). As the printer consumes a lot of power when it
      is working, even a normal consumer level Desktop UPS is incapable of keeping the printer online for more than a few minutes. One major issue is the inefficient AC-DC-AC conversion
      in the UPS, the printer require only 12v DC, the UPS's internal battery is a 12v Lead-Acid battery, but when ewe use UPS, the UPS first converts the 12v to 2630v AC and the n
      the SMPS od the printer converts it back to 12v DC. The overall efficiency of this process will be about 50% only. I'm thinking about making an online UPS designed specifically
      for this printer, consisting of a decent 12v Lead-Acid battery, a 12v stabilizer/battery protection circuit and a power-supply capable of charging the battery and simultaneously
      supply enough power to the printer. This might be the next assignment.
      <br> Once I get to connect the printer to an UPS from YAdu's home, we test printed a
      <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:830666">clip</a> for supporting the LCD panel as it slexes while using the push button (reset) or the rotary switch. The design is from
      <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a>.

      This print took little more than an hour as we printed it slow, during this time there were 4 power failures and the UPS saved us. But on the last power failure the UPS didn't have
      enough 'juice' left and we had to abort, but we lost only a few layers(about 2mm only), but the part is still useful.

      Now it's time for the assignment. We are supposed to print something that can't be made substantively. After a few thought I decoded to print a mobile stand/dock with audio canals for
      redirecting the sound. Such a Dock will have internal channels for directing audio, and this is something that cannot be made using even the most advanced CNC mill, absolutely
      no way to create subtractively as a single piece, because no tool can get inside the solid block to carve out complex cavities.

    <h4>Dock for OnePlus One</h4>
    <p>
      After a few searches I found a design at
      <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:507576">Thingiverse</a> (the design may be different from what I made as the designer refines it often). Once I had the design I edited the .stl file using
      <a href="https://www.rhino3d.com/">Rhino3D</a>. I replaced one of the Oneplus logo with my logo. For this I loaded the .stl file and duplicated the edges of the logo using 'DupEdge' command. Then the new lines
      are joined together to a continues curve and this curve is used to extrude a solid which will fill the logo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extra horse-shoe shaped object is a retention clip for fixing the Oneplus charging cable in place.

      </figure>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the oneplus logo is gone, and next step is to embed my logo over there. I had made the logo long time back, and I had the .svg file with me. This file was imported to the design
      file and moved and rotated as required to bring it to the surface from which I removed the logo before.
      <br> Then I select the curve of my logo and extruded about 2mm outwards so that my logo will protrude a bit from the final print.
      <br> here is the final design hosted at

      <b>This design is not perfect as the mesh has a lot of unwanted vertices and faces, perhaps 10 times more than what is really required.</b> This happened while I edited the original
      .stl file.

    <h4>Klein Bottle</h4>
    <p>
      This is another design I made,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_bottle">Klein Bottle</a>, this structure is something similar to
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip">Mobius Strip</a>, a one sided one edged surface. A true Klein Bottle is a 4-Dimensional object and what I designed/going to make is a 3D-projection/Immersion of the true Klein
      Bottle. In another words it's similar to seeing a photograph, which is 2D, but the object seen in the photograph may be 3D, so we see a 2D photograph of a 3D object. Just like
      that what I'm going to make is a 3D-photograph or a 3D-print of the 4D-Klein bottle.

      <br> This was a quick design in Rhino3D. I saw Yadu trying to design another version of this after getting inspired by a talk by
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wAaI_6b9JE">Matt Parker</a>. I extruded two circles along two rails, which is actually the cross section of the Klein-Bottle. The actual cross section would be a single line, so I broke the
      line at the bottom, in to two segments and used them as the rails for the circles to sweep (sweep2). The Two circles are necessary Two create a solid wall, else the object will
      be just a shell without0 any thickness and it cannot be 3D-printed. Then the bottoms where capped to close and a solid base was created to give the bottom some thickness. Also
      'trim' command was used create the hole which should have been there at the intersection of the surface(at the bottom of the 'handle').
      <br> This again is an object impossible to made subtractively, there is no way the tool can reach the inside of the bottle.

    <h3>Random</h3>
    <p>
      Below is a video of a print with a overhang structure, but without the support structure. So the wheel of the car is getting printed on air, and the material just drops. This was a
      print by
      <a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/fablabtrivandrum/students/403/index.html">Vinod</a> and I took this video when I saw it. The print recovered somewhat, this could be due to the fact that the overhang structure is not that wide and also because the separation
      between the overhang and the nearest 'platform' is very less.
