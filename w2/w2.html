        <h1>Computer-Aided Design</h1>
        <p>

          <a href="../w1/w1.html">Last week</a> I thought about the project and just scribbled something on the paper, some rough sketch, trying to explain the process. I also made some guesses about how to make the machine and what could be the merits and demerits.
          This week we are supposed to take our project one step further. I have to explore the Computer-Aided Design (CAD) softwares and make a design of the machine I'm trying to make.
