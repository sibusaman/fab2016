      <h1>Computer-Aided Design</h1>
      <p>

        <a href="../w1/w1.html">Last week</a> I thought about the project and just scribbled something on the paper, some rough sketch, trying to explain the process. I also made some guesses about how to make the machine and what could be the merits
        and demerits. This week we are supposed to take our project one step further. I have to explore the Computer-Aided Design (CAD) softwares and make a design of the machine I'm trying to make.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before I start designing the machine, I wanted to make sure about the following.
        <ul>
          <li>That the idea actually works; Yeah, it does. (see the video and pictures below)</li>
          <li>The availability of the parts required and their dimension, especially the stepper drive from the CD/DVD drive.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>'First Light'.</h3>
      <p>
        So I wanted to know how fast this technique will remove material from the PCB (it can remove for sure, I had experienced this on several occasions when accidentally made short-circuits and sparks). So I decided to test it, took a used PCB, put a drop
        of water connected the lab power supply. I went ahead and kept the maximum voltage (30v) at a limit of 1A. I kept the voltage that high because if I had kept low voltage the distance between the electrodes would have to be too short and that will
        be very-very difficult (our hands are not stable like machine). The ground was connected to the copper, the positive terminal (actually the polarity is not important) is connected to a broken blade of the Vinyl cutter.

      <h3>The process</h3>
      <br>

      <br>
      <p>
        <h2>Note:-</h2> I recorded the video in my phone and used the tool <a href="https://handbrake.fr/">handbrake</a>. This tool is like a frontend to the ffmpeg and other libraries like Libav, x264, x265 etc. Everything is GUI based, this is really useful
        if you want to crop videos. You can set cropping, transcoding options, audio/video formats and quality, codecs etc.
      </p>
      <h3>The result.</h3>
      <br>
      <figure>
        <img src="tr1-result.png" alt="trial-1 result" onmouseover="this.width='1000'" onmouseout="this.width='500'">
        <figcaption style="display:inline; color:grey">The result of the process shown in the video, notice that the copper has been removed by the sparks. If you watch carefully there is a discoloration too as a result of electrolysis.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        So, now I'm confident that the technique will work. As a result of the process the copper from the board has been removed. The tool is also getting eroded. All that is left to do is to
        <ul>
          <li>Find a material with low wear, something that can withstand the sparks, tungsten looks promising as it is being used for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_tungsten_arc_welding">TIG</a> welding.</li>
          <li>Design a way to precisely feed the tool wire.</li>
          <li>Design an X-Y axis control using the salvaged components from CD/DVD drive.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>3D-CAD</h2>
      <p>
        <h3>Antimony</h3>
        <br> I tried antimony to design a rough shape of the stepper motor from the CD/DVD drive. You can see the video of my design process, because a picture is worth a thousand words and this video is made up of about 85 of them(pictures)!
        <br>I made this video by taking many screenshots and combining them using ffmpeg. I used <a href="https://github.com/Roger/escrotum">escrotum</a> to capture the screen, I made a keyboard shortcut such that when I press <code>PrtScn</code> button a
        command <code>escrotum ~/Pictures/%Y-%m-%d-%T.png</code> will be executed, and that will save a screen shot to the ~/Pictures directory. You can also do this with default screenshot programs like for example 'Spectacle' for KDE-Plasma Desktop
        Environment I use. After that I used ffmpeg to combine these images to a short movie.
        <br>
        <pre>
          ffmpeg -framerate 2 -i %03d.png -c:v libx264 -r 10 -pix_fmt yuv420p test.mp4
        </pre>
        <br> I had renamed all image files as 001.png, 002.png 003.png..... using the batch rename properties of KDE (just select all files you want to rename and select rename).
        <br>
        <code>-framerate 2</code> tells that two images per second or in other words each image will get 1/2 a second.
        <br>
        <code>-i %03d.png</code> tells that the files are named as 001.png, 002.png 003.png.....
        <br>
        <code>-c:v libx264</code> tells to use the x264 video codec
        <br>
        <code>-r 10</code> will give a final video stream with 10 frames per second, 10 fps is fine as we don't have any fast moving action, its all static images.

        </video>
        <br><br>
        <a href="motor.sb" download="sibu-stepper-antimony.sb">Antimony files for the above design</a>.
        <br>
        <br> As you can see, I can change few numbers like the diameter of the motor, shaft-length and I get a new motor. I had to do this because I'm not sure that all the motors I will be getting will be of the same dimensions, but in general, shape of
        the motors are all the same. Antimony is really good at this, it's a parametric CAD. If you want to make a correction to any dimension or sometimes the shape, most probably you can do that with just changing a few numbers. Tools like <a href="https://www.rhino3d.com/">Rhino3D</a>        cannot do this, you have to redesign the entire model from scratch.
        <br> This parametric design feature will be very useful, especially when you want to fine-tune dimensions of your design. One scenario where this will be useful is when you want to design a press-fit construction for cutting in a laser cutter or CNC
        mill. The benefit is that you can just adjust a few parameters depending on what cutting tool you are using or whats the beam width of the laser. You can fine tune the design by changing the parameters till you get a very tight fit.
        <br> There are few draw-backs to Antimony. One important thing is that its not stable enough, atleast with my installation. It crashes sometimes when I move the object too much, so at times I lose my unsaved progress and will have to start-over. At
        times it is really stable too. Another demerit is that the rendering is not really that good or fast enough. I wish the software uses GPU for rendering (I don't know if it already does, but if yes it looks like the implementation is not efficient).
        Third major problem I faced is the lack of tools, it doesn't have the huge set of functions/tools that major CAD softwares comes with, but the idea is to create everything with simple 'building blocks'. For this reason I'll have to use something
        like SolidWorks or AutoCad for more complicated design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I need to design the rest of the machine. I cannot do this unless I procure all the raw material I can gather. Once I have them, I'll design a machine that will make the best use of the parts I collected.
