      <h1>Computer-Aided Design</h1>
      <p>

        <a href="../w1/w1.html">Last week</a> I thought about the project and just scribbled something on the paper, some rough sketch, trying to explain the process. I also made some guesses about how to make the machine and what could be the merits
        and demerits. This week we are supposed to take our project one step further. I have to explore the Computer-Aided Design (CAD) softwares and make a design of the machine I'm trying to make.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before I start designing the machine, I wanted to make sure about the following.
        <ul>
          <li>That the idea actually works; Yeah, it does. (see the video and pictures below)</li>
          <li>The availability of the parts required and their dimension, especially the stepper drive from the CD/DVD drive.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>'First Light'.</h3>
      <p>
        So I wanted to know how fast this technique will remove material from the PCB (it can remove for sure, I had experienced this on several occasions when accidentally made short-circuits and sparks). So I decided to test it, took a used PCB, put a drop
        of water connected the lab power supply. I went ahead and kept the maximum voltage (30v) at a limit of 1A. I kept the voltage that high because if I had kept low voltage the distance between the electrodes would have to be too short and that will
        be very-very difficult (our hands are not stable like machine). The ground was connected to the copper, the positive terminal (actually the polarity is not important) is connected to a broken blade of the Vinyl cutter.

      <h3>The process</h3>
      <br>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zf7_GY7GMV4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <br>
      <h3>The result.</h3>
      <br>
      <figure>
        <img src="tr1-result.png" alt="trial-1 result" onmouseover="this.width='1000'" onmouseout="this.width='500'">
        <figcaption style="display:inline; color:grey">The result of the process shown in the video, notice that the copper has been removed by the sparks. If you watch carefully there is a discoloration too as a result of electrolysis.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        So, now I'm confident that the technique will work. As a result of the process the copper from the board has been removed. The tool is also getting eroded. All that is left to do is to
        <ul>
          <li>Find a material with low wear, something that can withstand the sparks, tungsten looks promising as it is being used for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_tungsten_arc_welding">TIG</a> welding.</li>
          <li>Design a way to precisely feed the tool wire.</li>
          <li>Design an X-Y axis control using the salvaged components from CD/DVD drive.</li>
          
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>PS:-</h2> I recorded the video in my phone and used the tool <a href="https://handbrake.fr/">handbrake</a>. This tool is like a frontend to the ffmpeg and other libraries like Libav, x264, x265 etc. Everything is GUI based, this is really useful if you want to crop videos. You can set cropping, transcoding options, audio/video formats and quality, codecs etc.
