            The
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babbitt_(alloy)">Babbitt</a> metal, once used extensively as a bearing material. Hence I'm going to try making a plane bearing out of this.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'll be using the high temperature silicone to make the mold for the babbitt metal. This will be casted with the m8 steel rod inside. The steel rod will be coated with fairly thick
            layer of carbon soot from a candle flame. This soot should prevent the babbitt metal from sticking with the steel rod, acts like a release agent.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
            Next day, once the silicone is set (this silicone sets very quick, in just few hours), I had to remove the the plastic part inside, I could have cut it open, but it will remove the
            silicone ring inside. So I decided to heat the PLA part inside to soften/melt it and remove it with the help of tweezers.

            </figure>
            Anyway the attempt failed and I had to cut it open when I lost the silicone ring I was trying to preserve. I abandoned this method completely for various other reason too. Now I made
            a new mold.

                <figcaption style="display:block; color:grey">The silicone was poured into the mold made of the printed positive part and aluminum foil as the container. Also notice the scrap pieces of same kind of silicone, this
                    will be used as a filler. </figcaption>

                <figcaption style="display:block; color:grey">After pouring about 1/3rd of the silicone, enough to have a reasonably thick coat of silicone all over the plastic mold, the scrap silicone is added. After this all
                    of the remaining silicone is poured into the mold, binding all the scrap pieces together.
                    <br> This will save a lot of new material, and is okay as the silicone sticks very well to the silicone. If I were to use new silicone only, I would have to use a lot
                    of it as the mold has to be thick.
                    <br> I SHOULD HAVE SHREDDED THE SILICONE INTO MUCH SMALLER PIECES. enough to be reasonably rigid.</figcaption>

                <figcaption style="display:block; color:grey">The result, strong enough! and the scrap silicone really bonded well with the new silicone. Also the inner surface was smooth. Not much bubbles, though I expected more
                    as I used lot of scrap, but I made a good effort to get rid of the bubbles by placing the entire mold-container on a piece of plywood and shaking it well.</figcaption>

                    release any gases on heating; some talcum powders do release gases on heating, causing bubble formation in the final cast. </figcaption>

        <h3>The Result of Metal Casting</h3>
        <p>
            The results were amazing, its extremely smooth and no instability (no wobbliness). It woks better than some of my cheap Chinese LM8UUs. Remember, these results are without any kind
            of lubrication (may the carbon soot left from the casting process). But I think if I use some kind of lubrication like oil, grease or graphite powder, the results will be
            even better.
            <br> AND THE BEST PART!
            <br> No noise, its silent.

        <h3>Final Thoughts on The Linear Bearing</h3>
        <p>
            <h4>Advantages</h4>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Extremely smooth. *</li>
                    <li>Extremely stable.</li>
                    <li>Almost no noise.</li>
                    <li>Can't comment on the cost, may the cost is high if you include the time invested, the material cost and the energy cost etc. But the joy you get after seeing your
                        product working way beyond your imagination is just enough to neglect any of those expenses.</li>
                    <li>I'm intended to use these bearings on the shafts I salvaged from the printers. These shafts are not all the same diameter, there are shafts of 8mm, 7.8mm, 8.1mm
                        etc. Since I'm making bearings myself, I can make them to fit precisely for each rod I have. </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
            <p>
                So far I found only one problem, sometimes, when the bearing is cold, like &lt;25&#8451;, the bearing is not so smooth anymore, the material shrinks, and the inner diameter of the bearing
                gets reduced. The solution could be to do the casting at a higher temperature, and maintaining the temperature till the babbitt solidifies. This will make the Babbitt
                harden around an expanded shaft. Another solution could be to use a thicker coating of the soot, but this will not be repeatable and reliable. Yet another solution is
                to put the shaft inside and connect it to a drill and let the wear and tear does the work.
            </p>
        </p>

        <h2 id="modela">Using the Modela to Make the Mold in the Machinable Wax</h2>
        <p>
            Though I designed and made the mold myself and used it to successfully cast parts, our instructor, Franc, said that it might be invalid as I didn't use Modela to mill the mold in wax.
            I actually agree with him, the purpose of each assignment is to learn something new, explore the unexplored. For making the mold I used 3D printing, I know about the process
            quite well, what else to say, I even made a 3D-printer for me. The task could be done using 3D printing, but then I won't be learning anything new.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fact is that I didn't knew how to mill something in modela, so I took a shortcut, the focus was only the end result, not the method. Thanks to Franc, for pushing me to use the modela
            to make the mold.
        </p>
        <p>
            At first I tried the default Windows tools came with the machine, but I found these software lack the freedom, I couldn't adjust the parameters as I wish, like in fab-modules. Also,
            the tool was quite confusing in terms of units, I think in metric, but the software uses a mix of metric and imperial units, and I got frustrated and left it immediately,
            rebooted to my Arch Linux system and started fab modules.
        </p>
        <p>
            First I redesigned the mold slightly with more keys for accurate positioning of the two halves.

            The milling process with fab-modules is almost similar to all other processes, choose the correct options (stl to mdx-20 rml in this case), set the origin, set the tool parameters and
            go.
        </p>
        <p>
            For 3D milling the interface is struggling a little bit if I load <code>.stl</code> with fine details, when I used mesh size of 0.01 mm the software will run out of memory,
            will freeze the system and eventually get terminated or crashes.
            <br> So I exported stl with (from rhino) .1 or .05 mm mesh size which worked fine.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another problem I had was with the orientation of the stl, I had my model upside down and hence the the height map(generated by the make .png option) was not getting generated (or showing
            only the flat bottom of the model). So I had to choose <code>-z</code> option from the choice of the sides. Rest of the settings was left default.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the tool I choose 1/8" flat bottom for roughing, an error pixel value of <code>0.5</code> for better precision. After this I set the origin and started milling.
            <br> And I strted the milling process.
        </p>

        <h3>Milling</h3>
        <p>
            <figure>
                <img src="rough-halfway.jpg" width="600" title="double click => zoom-in; single click => normal size" ondblclick="this.width='1300'" onclick="this.width='600'" />
                <figcaption style="display:block; color:grey">Roughing with 1/8" two flute, flat bottom bit, milling progress is about 50%.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br> After a while, I noticed that the model is getting milled very close to the surface, not deep enough for a mold, so I had to increase (increase the magnitude, decrease
            the value as the value is negative) the top and bottom z. But I can't just change it, because it just plunge into the wax by the extra mm's I'm specifying and it might break
            the bit. So I started to decrease the parameters <code>top z (mm)</code> and <code>bot z (mm)</code> at steps of <code>1.5 mm</code> to a final <code>top z</code> value
            of <code>-6 mm</code>. Between each change in z values I will stop the job and put the new values and start the process all over again keeping the same X-Y origin.
            <figure>
                <img src="rough-halfway-set.png" width="600" title="double click => zoom-in; single click => normal size" ondblclick="this.width='1300'" onclick="this.width='600'" />
                <figcaption style="display:block; color:grey">Screenshot of the parameters I used for roughing.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <br>Also I don't wait for the entire rouging process to complete just wait for the top layer to complete and then proceed with the next values.
            <br> But clearly this is not the way to do it, I should have made some structure taller than my model in the original stl, then this problem would never arise.
        </p>
        <p>
            <figure>
                <img src="roughing-done.jpg" width="600" title="double click => zoom-in; single click => normal size" ondblclick="this.width='1300'" onclick="this.width='600'" />
                <figcaption style="display:block; color:grey">Roughing completed, the steps are 1mm in height and will be removed during the finishing. The machining marks looks cool!.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            Now that the Roughing is done, it's time to change the bit with 1/8" ball nose for finishing mill. Remeber the origin and use these values if you have to change them for the purpose
            of setting the bit to correct z position.
            <figure>
                <img src="finish-1-8-ball.png" width="600" title="double click => zoom-in; single click => normal size" ondblclick="this.width='1300'" onclick="this.width='600'" />
                <figcaption style="display:block; color:grey">Screenshot of the parameters I used for finishing with 1/8" ball nose.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="1-8 finish.jpg" width="600" title="double click => zoom-in; single click => normal size" ondblclick="this.width='1300'" onclick="this.width='600'" />
                <figcaption style="display:block; color:grey">Finishing done with 1/8" ball nose. Notice that we almost have the final shape, and the machine pattern is still there, nice. For a better result I'll be moving to 1/16"
                    ball nose bit.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <b>As you can see, the rouging process milled away most of the material, and the tool path was actually like a contour plot. The finish cut gave the final shape to the crude
                model made by the rough cut, and the tool path was like a grid along XY plane. It is clear from the two snapshots above.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Now we have an almost finalized shape, but not exactly what we need, for that we need a finer details and we need to move on to 1/16" bit. But there is no tool choice.
            <br>
            <b>But the that's beauty of the fab-module</b>, you can 'hack' it, you can just put the correct diameter of the tool, here you have to give <code>1.5875</code> as the <code>tool diameter</code>            and the <code>clearance</code>, and off you go.
            <figure>
                <img src="finish-1-16-ball.png" width="600" title="double click => zoom-in; single click => normal size" ondblclick="this.width='1300'" onclick="this.width='600'" />
                <figcaption style="display:block; color:grey">Screenshot of the parameters I used for finishing with 1/16" ball nose.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="1-16-finish.jpg" width="600" title="double click => zoom-in; single click => normal size" ondblclick="this.width='1300'" onclick="this.width='600'" />
                <figcaption style="display:block; color:grey">Final result of finishing with 1/16" ball nose.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            Notice the pattern throughout the area? I did this by lowering the z positions slightly, I did this on purpose as I like the pattern when it appeared first after the finishing with
            1/8" ball nose. Here are the parameters I used for that.

    <h3>
      <strike>Custom In Ear Monitor</strike> Edit:- This project has been frozen for the time being.</h3>
    <p>
      Trying to make a custom IEM(in ear monitor) using epoxy resin to take imprint of the ear canal. Like this guy did
      <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Making-a-custom-in-ear-monitor/?ALLSTEPS">here</a>.

      <br>
      <br>

        <br> These are images of few more professionally made custom IEMs, costing couple of 100s of $s.

      epoxy putty to take the impression and
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_jelly">Petroleum jelly</a> as a releasing agent, so that it doesn't stick tot he skin of my ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have successfully taken the impression, (PICTURES ARE COMING SOON). Though I used plenty of petroleum jelly, the epoxy had bonded with the tiny hair on the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auricle_(anatomy)">pinna</a> and it was painful. The epoxy had removed all hair from Cymba and Cavum of Concha (sounds complicated see the picture from Wikipedia, below). It was like waxing but
      without wax, instead epoxy, removed all hair.

        <img src="pinna.png" alt="box" width="600" title="double click => zoom-in; single click => normal size" ondblclick="this.width='900'" onclick="this.width='600'" />

      </figure>
      <br>I failed the first time as I moved my jaws too much. The impression was not as tight fitting as I was expecting it to be. But the first attempt had all the hair removed from my
      ear, so the second attempt was painless, and done easier and had the expected quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      I watched several videos from professionals

    <p>
      Most of these project involves costly, high-end stuff, not easily accessible for DIYers, limited by many factors including, price and minimum quantity. Especially the professionals
      use, standard medical supplies to get the ear impression, most suggest to visit a Doctor and get it done professionally. Then for the final shell of the Custom IEM, they use UV-sensitive
      resins and stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway I decided to use only what I can easily get from hardware/medical supply store and what is available in the FabLab.
