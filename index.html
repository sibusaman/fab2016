        <h2>I'm moving my site to GitHub.com for the following reasons
          <ul>
            <li>Constant error with connectivity to GitLab Api. I have to try couple of times before I can push.</li>
            <li>We are on a 2Mbps connection, so I don't want to waste time and bandwidth and time by downloading all the content from others before I can push mine. There is faster connection available but port 22 is blocked and 443 is open but GitLab doesn't
              support that. </li>
            <li>Sometimes we may use our own personal Internet connection and the bytes are very costly here, so I don't want to pay for downloading the content which I don't want.</li>
            <li>It's safer since nobody can delete my data and I can't mess with other's. I like to be the master of my creation and I want take responsibility for anything that may happen to my content.</li>

        <h2> Hello World </h2>

        <br>
        <p>Welcome to Sibu's Fab-Academy page, where I'll be logging my activities during the Fab-Academy.</p>
        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Sibu Saman, I have a Masters Degree in Physics from <a href="http://cbs.ac.in/">UM-DAE CBS</a>. During this time I gained experience in experimental physics, experimental design, computational electrodynamics and GPU computing.
          <br> Apart from that I taught myself some basic analogue and digital electronics. I'm good with Linux, computer hardware,programming in C and I also know little bit of networking. I'm familiar with micro-controllers, Arduino, R-Pi etc. I also have
          some experience with assembly language.
          <br> I like to make things to solve my problems, or sometimes just for the fun. For example, during the Pre-Acadamy (what? keep reading!) I started building (with a friend, <a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/fablabtrivandrum/students/384/index.html"> Yadu</a>)a
          soldering station. I choose this project because there was only one soldering station for all of us, as someone burned the other. This is how I learn most of the stuff, picking up as and when I need them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently, I assembled a 3D printer and I have a sufficiently good knowledge about building, maintaining and troubleshooting the 3D-printer and similar machines. As for other machines; during the Pre-Academy course I learned how to use most of the machines
          available at Fablab. Pre-Academy was a course, may be the only one happened so far, at FabLabs in Kerala, India. The purpose was to bootstrap us for the Fab Academy. Since we wouldn't have a local instructor for the Fab-Academy, we are supposed
          to have some basics knowledge of the machines available and get familiar with the principal and work-flow of the Academy. For the Academy, we were supposed to learn from each other with the support of our remote instructor.
        </p>
        <p>
          We (me and Yadu) are planning to setup a maker-space at our city of Kozhikode and the Fab-Academy will definitely help us do that.

        <br>This was a pre-academy project, and during the period I couldn't complete the project the way I wanted to. But this project is very important and I will keep working.
