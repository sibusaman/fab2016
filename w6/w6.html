    <h1>Electronics Design</h1>
    <p>
      The target of this module is to introduce PCB designing.
      <br> I have already done a few circuit designs, rather redesigned a the Fab-ISP key version to include two LEDs and replaces the crystal and two capacitors with a resonator. The documentation
      is available at
      <a href="../w4/w4.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.cadsoftusa.com/">EAGLE</a> is the preferred PCB design tool for me. I have been using this tool for some time. I have used a few other tools before, like
      <a href="http://www.sunstone.com/pcb-products/pcb123">PCB123</a>,
      <a href="http://kicad-pcb.org/">KiCAD</a> and I have a little bit of experience with
      <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/kokopelli">Kokopelli</a>.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      There are few more designs I made for different various purposes. One such project is about making a
      <a href="http://sibusaman.github.io/DIY-Soldering-Station/">DIY Soldering Station</a>, basically a controller for the Weller PES51 pencil. I designed an PCB which
      <ol>
        <li>Will amplify the signals from temperature sensor in the Pencil, </li>
        <li>Has a MOSFET to control the power delivered to the pencil, </li>
        <li>Has an NTC temperature sensor for getting the room temperature for accurate control of the iron.</li>
      </ol>

          other dirt on it, so 'I did what I have to do'. (or!!! what I wanted to do). And YES, this is a double sided PCB.

      <br> The work is still in progress, but progress is slow. The hardware is mostly over and what is left is the firmware. I have also designed a compact Arduino-UNO compatible (only
      software, no hardware/pin compatibility) micro-controller board for use in the soldering station.

    <h2>Exploring Further.</h2>
    <p>
      I know, I have done more than enough for this modules assignment. But all of the above circuits were made before and I have a week to do something, I'm exploring a few options. I have
      a few ideas, few things I needed, so I might be making one or more of the below list.
      <ol>
        <li>
          A 12V lead-acid based DC UPS for the 3D printer: This is also useful (with some modification) as a Desktop UPS as the normal UPSs convert the 12V to 230 V AC and then the SMPS inside
          the PC converts it again to 12V, 5V and 3.3V. So I can improve the system efficiency if I were to use DC-DC converter to generate a stable 12V, 5V and 3.3V from the Lead-Acid
          battery directly.
        </li>
        <li>
          A servo tester, a small board that supplies PWM signals to test the servo/BLDC motor. The PWM duty cycle will be controlled by a rotary switch. Something like the one seen at
          <a href="http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__14774__HobbyKing_8482_Servo_Tester.html">HobbyKing</a> or this
          <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-Servo-Tester/">Instructables</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          A stepper tester similar to above.
        </li>
      </ol>
