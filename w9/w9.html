    <h1>Mechanical Design</h1>
    <p>
      This time, we are supposed to design a machine. I said we, because this is a group assignment. Franc made our big batch of some 14 students at the
      <a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/fablabtrivandrum/">FabLab Trivandrum</a> into two groups of 7.
      <br>

      </ul>
      And last but not the least myself, the team leader, as decided by our instructor Francisco.
    </p>

    <h2>Stage 1. Ideation</h2>

    <p>
      <br> Our team members came up with the following ideas, inspired by what's seen in the links.
      <ul>

        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      After the internal discussion, with majority voting for 'CNC Lathe', we decided to pool the resources for the same.
    </p>

    <h3>Pooling</h3>

    <p>
      We decided to gather all possible resources we could use for this project. From my own experience and a bit of reading, I knew that there are a few things that is a must for a lathe.
      <ul>
        <li>A Headstock with a Chuck to hold the workpiece and a motor to power the spindle.</li>
        <li>A tool-holder/tool-post that can be moved precisely along X and Y. (one along the axis of spindle and other perpendicular to it)</li>
      </ul>
      And optionally a tail-stock to support the workpiece.
      <br> I found the following designs that could be used as it is or could be modified to suit our needs.
    </p>

    <h3>Chuck</h3>

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:624625">This</a> is a nice 3D-printable chuck design by
      <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/bobwomble/about">Bob</a>
      and made by
      <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/yuri9999/about">Yuri9999</a> from
      <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a>
      <figure>
        <img src="chuck.png" alt="CNC plotter" width="600" onmouseover="this.width='900'" onmouseout="this.width='600'" />
        <figcaption style="display:block; color:grey">Source file available
          <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:624625/#files">here</a>.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      This is already perfect design for a 3D-Printable chuck and we are going to use as it is. No need to reinvent the wheel!
      <br>
      <br> This chuck will hold the workpiece and will be attached to a Drill or some other motor or Dremel tool, though I am doubtful if Dremel has the sufficient Torque for the purpose,
      it definitely has the speed.
    </p>

    <h3>X-Y Stages.</h3>

    <p>
      The tool need to move in the horizontal plane (X and Y), but unlike 3D-printer X-Y motion this need not be fast. Infact it has to be slow and precise movement. So a lead-screw is the
      best solution. We plan to use normal threaded rod and bolts for the actuation, as this sis a prototype and proof of concept work. A screw based motion has other advantages like
      it can withstand lot of axial load.
      <br>
      <br> We decided to use a simple stage, 2 guide rodes and a threaded rod at the center attached to a stepper. Something like the first picture in this page, something simple as the
      modular stages
      <figure>
        <img src="recon-stage.png" alt="reconfigurable stage" width="600" onmouseover="this.width='900'" onmouseout="this.width='600'" />
        <figcaption style="display:block; color:grey">
          <a href="http://mtm.cba.mit.edu/machines/stages/">Source</a>.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      But this need to be strong too, made using plywood or acrylic. Need not be long as the examples above, we need only about 10-15cm motion along X and Y.
    </p>

    <h3>Overall design.</h3>

    <p>
      The overall final design could be based on the following sources.
      <br>
      <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4rrh6Pl4vow" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

      <a href="https://github.com/Intrinsically-Sublime/Printable-Lathe-V2">https://github.com/Intrinsically-Sublime/Printable-Lathe-V2</a>
      <br>He included a 3D-printed chuck too, and powered by a drill just like how we are planing to use.
      <br> Another design that we could use is this one,
      <br>

      <a href="http://robinsonia.com/wp/?page_id=338">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Stage 2. Gathering Parts</h2>
    <p>
      Our instructor set a rule of not buying any mechanical components for the machine, instead salvage or make it yourself. A good suggestion, but I personally do not want to strictly adhere
      to this. As every comp net we are going to use is bought from somewhere at sometime in some form. So I (and very likely most of us in the lab) will adhere to the rule that "we
      will be making or salvaging whatever we could, we will do the best we can". This is because not everything could be made or salvaged, for example fasteners, threaded rod, timing
      belts etc cannot be made, even if we could that won't even match the cheapest options we could find from the market. Then there is time and other resources involved.
    </p>

    <h3>Scrap Hunt</h3>

    <p>
      Anyway a few of us Me,
      <a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/fablabtrivandrum/students/384/index.html">Yadu</a>,
      <a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/fablabtrivandrum/students/400/index.html">Vishnu</a>,
      <a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/fablabtrivandrum/students/388/index.html">Nadeem</a> and
      <a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/fablabtrivandrum/students/398/index.html">Safwan</a> went in search of old printers from E-waste collectors. We were hopping to get Motors including stepper motors, threaded rods, smooth rods, timing belts, other useful
      mechanical components like gears, springs, screws. We could also get many useful electronics components too, like power-bricks (power bricks of the printers), positions sensors,
      switches, connectors etc.
      <figure>
        <img src="scrap.jpg" alt="scrap" width="600" onmouseover="this.width='900'" onmouseout="this.width='600'" />
        <figcaption style="display:block; color:grey">One printer disassembled, just a beginning, a total of 5 printers were dismantled for the parts.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </p>

    <p>
      We got a total of 5 printers at an expense of about INR 700 or about USD 10. Since we were at it we also got a few other stuff like two Weller pencils for about INR 30 (about 50 cents),
      even if the elements are damaged the thick flexible heat resistants cable in those pencils are worth more than we spent on them.
      <br> In summary, this is what we got.
      <ul>
        <li>9 X DC Motors.</li>
        <li>1 X Stepper motors.</li>
        <li>3 X 8mm, 40cm smooth rods.</li>
        <li>3 X 8mm, 30cm smooth rods with a gear like tooths at 1/3rd the length.</li>
        <li>5 X 6mm smooth rods of various lengths.</li>
        <li>5 X long timing belts and few shorter ones.</li>
        <li>2 X Possibly working 230V AC to 19V DC power bricks.</li>
        <li>Many optical positions sensors and endstops.</li>
        <li>Many screws and springs and gears of various types and sizes.</li>
      </ul>
      There are more items, like all those controller circuits from which we could get many tactile switches, a few Crystals, connectors etc. Then there is an HP scanner head, though I don't
      know how to use to and couldn't find any resources. Similarly, I recovered a Epson
      <a href="http://www.epson.com.sg/epson_singapore/explore_epson/innovation/micro_piezo.page">Micro-Piezo</a> inkjet head. This is a good material for future investigation as unlike the HP, thermal Inkjet technology, these Piezo heads can print almost any liquid, and controlling
      this could be done with precise shaped pulses to the piezo elements. Though this would be difficult, it's not impossible.
    </p>

    <h3>Other parts.</h3>

    <p>
      We got the smooth rods for the guide rails. But we couldn't get any threaded rods, and we need it for the machines. There are again multiple options, could use standard threaded rods
      that are used for fastening, we could use long bolts, or we could use the special high quality threaded rods made for actuation, like the ones used in Ultimaker's Z-axis. There
      was one vendor how refused to give anything short of 3m. We didn't require long threaded rods as this is a experimental build, need only smalled axes. We could use the long bolts
      instead, and we decided to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the construction will be using 6mm acrylic and may be the thick, 12mm or 18mm plywood as a base. We will be making a press-fit assembly in acrylic but will also use cyano-acrylic
      glue (super-glue) for extra strength.
      <br> For the guide rods we planned to use 2 of the 8mm rods and 2 of the 6mm rods.
      <br> The stepper motor to the threaded rod coupler will be printed. The design is from
      <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1329750">thingiverse</a>.

    </p>

    <h3>Electronics</h3>

    <p>
      For the electronics, The stepper motor driver chip is
      <a href="http://www.allegromicro.com/en/Products/Motor-Driver-And-Interface-ICs/Bipolar-Stepper-Motor-Drivers/A4988.aspx">Allegro A4988</a> in a
      <a href="https://www.pololu.com/product/1182">Breakout board</a>.
      <br> The stepper used will be the NEMA17 ones available in the Fablab inventory.
      <br> The main controller board can be my
      <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/RAMPS_1.4">RAMPS_1.4</a>. Or it could be the
      <a href="https://github.com/imoyer/086-005/tree/master/board/rev0.3">Gestalt Node V0.3</a> mod I'm making (
      <a href="../w10/w10.html">Documentation</a>). This board is mod so that ot uses the A4988 breakout instead of A4982.
      <br>
      <br>Though I really don't want to use this board for the following reasons.
      <ul>
        <li>We don not need the flexibility/modularity provided by the networked controller nodes.</li>
        <li>It's a huge waste of recourses, one Atmega328p, a crystal/resonator, the RS485 transceiver chip and whole lot of other passive electronic components for just controlling a stepper
          motor.
        </li>
        <li>The Atmega328p might be capable of controlling the two steppers and other things I wanted to solely.</li>
        <li>The framework is not mature enough. Or in other words it under heavy development.</li>
        <li>At present RAMPS 1.4 gives me more flexibility and options for expansion.</li>
        <li>....</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Stage 3. Construction</h2>
    <p>
      The difficult part would be the construction of the X-Y stages, the mechanical, linear movements for the X and Y axes. For some reason first we printed the parts that are required only
      at the last, perhaps we just wanted to start and these prints were made using ready to print files from thingiverse.
      <br>
      <br>First we printed the parts for the chuck.
    </p>

    <h3>Chuck</h3>

    </p>

    <h3>X and Y axes</h3>

    <p>
      Now comes the actual difficult part of the project. We need to design the X and Y stages using the materials available at the lab and the salvaged parts.
      <br>
      <br> We decided to make something simple using the smooth rods we have and the two long bolts. The basic design comes from my
      <a href="../w3/w3.html">Computer-Controlled Cutting</a> module, where I did a press-fit box in OpenSCAD. I modified the file to get the moving carriage and the overall axes. This is the modified OpenSCAD
      file for the X or Y carriage, The holes are meant for m8 threaded rod. The holes for the guide rods are such that either m6 or m8 smooth rods, the two set of walls has two different
      holes.

      The X-Y carriage design is ready, now we need to make an assembly for this box to slide. The base design for this also came from the above OpenSCAD design, this file is also edited
      in Rhino to have the mounting holes. The sizes of the stages are determined by the length of the smooth rods we have.

      During the construction we actually made a few mistakes and wasted a few pieces of acrylic, I should have done a test cut on cardboard before!.
      <br>
      <br> So, it's time for the redemption, to compensate for the wasted acrylic I decided to do the test cuts in a cardboard sheet cut from package.

    <h4>'Machines that make the machines'</h4>
    <p>
      We were supposed to be making a lathe, but we had to do a makeshift lathe to,
      <ul>
        <li>Cut a few of the smooth rods to length.</li>
        <li>Cut the head of the long bolts used for the actuation.</li>
        <li>Cut a few bolts to length, used for mounting.</li>
      </ul>
      We did this by fixing the work-piece to the drill and used the metal cutting Hacksaw blade as the cutting tool.

      <br> This is our first attempt to control the stepper via Gcode and first real test on my stage design. For more details head over to our

      <a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/fablabtrivandrum/students/424/index.html">Yogi's page</a> who is in charge of all the coding and stuff. Having made the X-Y stages and mounted the steppers, we mounted the stages two a single unit and used the RAMPS 1.4
      controller board. We decided to use the PC for the hard stuff, generating the Gcode and stuff. The serial communication is used to transfer the Gcodes, individually to the controller
      board and the Atmega2560 (Arduino Mega) will interpret the Gcode and will send the required signals to the motor controller, A4988. The micro controller need to send three set
      of data,
      <ul>
        <li>Enable (high/low):- to enable/disable the stepper, enabling means the stepper will always have power, whether it moves or not. When enabled the coils are energized and when
          not rotating, it holds it's position well, withstands a lot of load(external torque) before it spins. Obviously this has to be enabled if one wishes to use the stepper.</li>
        <li>Dir (high/low):- sets the direction of rotation.</li>
        <li>Steps (Pulses):- each pulse moves the stepper by one step.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <b>The motor and the board is powered by a 230V to 12V 3A AC-DC SMPS.</b>
      <br>
      <br> You can see a video of getting both the to move using the stepper via the serial interface between the computer and the micro-controller.

    <h1>!!!TWIST!!!</h1>
    <p>
      Perhaps you noticed it already, we started with the plan to make a lathe and ended up making a plotter. We may still continue with the lathe, the difficult part was the constructions
      and controlling of the stages, which has been achieved.

    <h2>Problems and failures.</h2>
    <p>
      Some of the problems I faced with the mechanical parts.
      <ul>
        <li>For the X-axis I used two nuts and a spring to keep them 'loaded'/under pressure. This worked great, there has been absolutely no problem with this stage except for the expected
          ones due to the bolt we used. The bolt we used is not meant for actuation purpose, it's not consistent or perfectly straight, this was causing some wobbliness. </li>
        <li>During the constructions of the second/Y-stage, there was an issue of misalignment, the nuts glued onto the Y-carriage was offset and was causing massive load on the motor and
          it was getting stuck/stalled. I fixed this by removing the nut and fixing it at the correct position.</li>
        <li>The bolt used for Y has a bent/dent or some kind of damage at the middle and the motor will get stuck stalled at the middle, so far we are unable to solve this. The best solution
          would be to get a new bolt.</li>
      </ul>
      And finally the best for the last. The stupidest mistake I made was that, I haven't give enough clearance for the mounting screws on the stages. That is if I were to mount the Y-stage
      to the box of X-stage, the Y carriage would get stuck because of the bolt heads. The bolt heads will come in the way of Y-carriage movement. The temporary solution is not to use
      the base plate of the box of the Y stage.
      <br>This has been a bigger problem for the Y-stage as the holes for the guide rods are not symmetric(symmetry over the horizontal plane).
