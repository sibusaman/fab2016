    <h1>Computer-Controlled Cutting</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      This week we are going to make use the two computer-aided cutting machines available at the lab, the
      <a href="http://www.troteclaser.com/en-US/Laser-Machines/Pages/laser-engraving-machines-speedy.aspx">Trotec-Speedy 100â€‹</a>
      laser cutter and the vinyl cutter. We are asked to make a pressfit construction kit using the laser cutter and something like a sticker, flexible PCB, stencil etc using the vinyl cutter.
      Before proceeding with the laser cutter I decided to get some numbers that will help me in designing the pressfit construct. I had some experience with both of the machines during
      the
      <a href="http://sibusaman.github.io/prefab/#hide2">pre-academy</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Checking the laser cutter properties to fine tune the press-fit.</h3>
    <!-- TODO: make this and write -->
    <p>
      I made the following pattern to see how much material the laser beam removes on each pass, this data can be used to while designing the final press-fit construction. We will have a
      chance for an intelligent guess rather than brute trial and error, to get a perfect fit. The design is made in antimony and is parametric, I can just change few numbers to change
      the number of slits, slit width, depth etc.
      <br>
      <video width="720" controls>

      <br>
      <br>
      <a href="pressfit-test.sb" download="sibu-pressfit-test-antimony.sb">Antimony files for the above design</a>.
      <br> While creating the above video, I used a trick to batch crop the individual .png files. I opened the files in Gimp used the selection tool to get some parameters for the command-line
      tool mogrify.
      <br>
      <code>mogrify -crop [WIDTH]x[HEIGHT]+[X-offset]+[Y-offset] [FILES]</code>
      <br>
      <figure>
        <img src="batch-crop.png" alt="batch-crop" width="500" onclick="this.width='1000'" onmouseout="this.width='499'">
        <figcaption style="display:inline; color:grey">Getting the parameters for mogrify using GIMP</figcaption>
      </figure>
      Note the highlighted area, also note the position of the cursor at top left corner(Red). You start selecting the area you want using the 'Rectangle Selection' tool from bottom right.
      Then you will have the
      <font color="blue">X and Y offset</font>
      values (BLUE) and the
      <font color="green">
        width and height</font>
      (RED).
      <br>so the final command would be.
      <br>
      <code>
          mogrify -crop 1858x944+32+78 *.png
        </code>
      <br> This will crop all the .png files in the directory to a size we choose in the GIMP. One can modify this command accordingly. After that you can use ffmpeg to merge these into
      a movie (I talked about this in
      <a href="../w2/w2.html">Week 2</a>).
    </p>

    <h2>Laser Cutter: Water Bath For EDM PCB Mill</h2>
    <p>
      I decided to take one more step towards my final project. The PCB Mill requires a water bath, as the machining requires the EDM process to be under a dielectric liquid, water in our
      case. So I decided to make a water bath using acrylic.
      <br>One of the assignment for this module is to make a press-fit construction set. And I made a container with a press-fit construction set, laser-cut acrylic (3mm).
    </p>
    <p>
      For the last module, I have made a parametric design of an open-box, a 'square-container'. I used that design to cut acrylic using the Laser Cutter. On the second trial with the cardboard
      I had a very tight-fitting cardboard joint. In total I made four attempts, two on cardboard and two on acrylic. I used all scrap materials (so thats why some pieces are missing
      or irregularly shaped), as I didn't want to waste material for trial-and-error. But it turned out hat my second attempt itself was a success!!.

      <a href="../w2/w2.html">last module</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I need to seal the gaps to make this container water tight. I can do this with some Cyno-acrylic based glue or just acetone(dissolves acrylic) or I can make my on acrylic glue by
      dissolving a few pieces of acrylic scrap in acetone.

    <h2>Improvised; Box With Lid.</h2>

      I modified the OpenSCAD design file a little bit to add lid to the box.

    <h2>Vinyl Cutter</h2>
    <p>
      As I said, I have had some experience with the vinyl cutter. I cut some vinyl stickers using the machine. This time I have more time and I want to go advanced. I decided to try something
      new something I couldn't do before. So, I choose to go with flexible PCBs.
    </p>

    <h3>GPS Antenna for my phone</h3>
    <p>
      In past, as a part of an unsuccessful experiment to fix the poor GPS reception of my LG-G2 phone, I had lost it's original GPS antenna. This is perfect chance to cut a GPS antenna from
      the 'copper sticker'. I knew the basic theory of the antenna as I did a 'mini-project' in college, the project was about constructing and measuring the radiation pattern of a
      Bi-Quad antenna for Wi-Fi. Anyway I didn't want to go that deep and decided to stick with something very simple, a folded Dipole antenna. The Folded Dipole antenna will have a
      total length (length of the loop) approximately equal to the wavelength of the signal the antenna is going to receive(or transmit). The GPS system uses many wavelengths, but for
      civilian navigation the signals are transmitted at
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System#Satellite_frequencies">1575.42 MHz</a>. This corresponds a wavelength of about 190mm in vacuum. But the electrical signals in copper don't travel as fast the light and we have to compensate for that,
      and the antenna will be shorter than the calculated wavelength. The factor depends on the material of the wire as the thickness and wavelength, typically it will be around .96-.98.
      <br> Anyway I approximated the length as 185mm and designed it (made in
      <a href="http://www.cadsoftusa.com/download-eagle/">Eagle-CAD</a>). The antenna will have a rough shape as follows the long strip (part other than the main loop) will go into the phone through a slit in the back cover of the phone
      (I have to make the slit, may be using the laser cutter!!).
      <br>
      <figure>
        <img src="antenna-beta.png" alt="antenna beta" width="500" onclick="this.width='1000'" onmouseout="this.width='499'">
        <figcaption style="display:inline; color:grey"></figcaption>
      </figure>
      As you can see the antenna has two semi-circles and effectively two long sections, the total length would have to be 185mm. I decided to keep the radius of the semi-circles as 6mm.
      So we have 2*pi*r(r=6) + 2*l = 185mm. Gives l = 73.6mm or l/2= 36.8mm .
      <br> Here is the final design of the antenna.This is not an Eagle file, rather a gray-scale image I will be using in the Vinyl cutter.

          The final design of the GPS antenna for the mobile phone.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      I will be pasting this on the back of my phone and the antenna will be attached to the spring contacts of the phone using a coaxial cable.

    <h4>Results</h4>
    <p>
      <figure>
        <img src="antenna-1.jpg" alt="antenna trial one" width="500" onclick="this.width='1000'" onmouseout="this.width='499'">
        <figcaption style="display:inline; color:grey">This is my first(bottom) and second (top) attempt to make the antenna.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      The first attempt was a failure, but it was expected, mainly because of the thin traces and the very poor adhesion between the copper layer and the substrate. Another reason is that
      I used some scrap piece of copper to do this trial. so in attempt one (bottom one) the traces came right off the substrate.
      <br> For trial two, I decided to improve the adhesion of the copper layer to the substrate.
      <h4 style="color:red">For this I took the copper layer completely from the substrate and pasted it on the non-sticky side of the wide masking tape. Then I pasted the masking tape with the copper layer
        onto the original substrate of the copper sheet, but on the back, non-glossy side.</h4>
      This will give give better adhesion and i got the second result (top), way better than the first one. But the traces are still thin.

    <p>
      All I need to do is to find a thin co-axial cable (I must have some, in my pile of e-junk) and make a connection from the spring contacts on the phone to the antenna. I'll update with
      more pictures and a few screen shots once I have the coaxial cable. If there is no tuning required on thus design, I'll finalize it and cut an antenna from a fresh copper sheet.

    <h3>Multi-Layer PCB Test</h3>
    <p>
      I know that the vinyl cutter can be used to make flexible circuits. And I have seen people doing it. I wanted to check if I can use the individual copper layers to make a multi-layer
      PCB. I don't have a need of an actual multi-layer circuit, so I decided to make something simple a, multilayer coil. This something similar to what we can find on an
      <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_and_Purple_RFID_tag.jpg">RFID/NFC tag</a>
      or a
      <a href="http://www.etradesupply.com/oem-nokia-lumia-920-wireless-charging-coil.html">wireless charger</a>. The difference is that we use multi-layer circuit instead of the traditional copper wire for the coil, and may result in a thinner profile. I intended to
      use this coil for a wireless charging experiment, for my phone, in future.
    </p>

      <figcaption style="display:inline; color:grey">
        The 4 layer coil.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The design has four layers, but the eagle-version I use only supports 2 actual copper layers. But there are a total of 52 or so layers for different purposes. Since I'm manually drawing
      all these traces, and I only intended to use the gray-scale exported image of individual layers, I can use any four layers, it doesn't matter which four. I used Top, Bottom copper
      layers as well as Milling and Unrouted layers for the tracks. The dimension layer is used for dimensions and the outline.
